            <p>The Crawford County Historical Society and Museum is a non-governmental, 501c3 non-profit corporation, dedicated to “Collecting, Preserving and Interpreting Documents and Artifacts that illustrate the history of Crawford County, Michigan”.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p><strong>What we do</strong>We collect documents and artifacts mostly through donations from the descendents of the early area pioneers.  Items range from the Native American cultures through the lumbering industry and early railroads on through the family histories of the first settlers.  Most of the items collected require some sort of preservation that may range from simply being placed in a protected showcase to being kept in a climate controlled environment.  For instance, early documents and photographs need to be mounted under acid-free matting behind UV filtered glass.</p>
            <p>These activities require both time and funding.</p>
            <p>We are fortunate to have the old Railway Depot to house our collection but it’s expensive to pay for the electric bill, gas bill, phone service and general building and grounds maintenance.  Archival preservation supplies are also costly.  In addition it does no good to the community to simply store the “stuff” away where no one can see or read about those early days.  Exhibits need to be assembled that tell a story and provide the details of the hardships and successes of our early families.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p><strong>How we are funded</strong>The Museum is funded exclusively through donations, sponsorships and the occasional grant.  There are no tax dollars being used.  Consequently there is usually a substantial gap between what we need and what we receive.  Thanks to the generosity of a few committed people, we continue to pay the bills and manage to keep our counties history intact and available for all to enjoy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p><strong>What we need</strong>Without a doubt, the most vital component to the museum’s success are our volunteers.  Without them, the rest of the parts just do not exist.  Volunteers are the ingredient that make the Museum possible.  Volunteers do the research that helps tell the stories behind our collections.  Volunteers welcome visitors and introduce them to the numerous aspects of our history.  Volunteers help develop the displays that tell the stories.  New volunteers are trained to understand what the Museum contains and what it means before they are placed on the front desk.  It’s a great experience to discover the many chapters of our county’s history.  It’s even better to share our rich history with visitors from all over our nation who journey to Crawford County to hunt, fish, camp, see the fall colors or to just enjoy the great “Up North” experience.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p><strong>Ways you can support</strong>There are many ways to support the museum.  It may be as a one-time donor or by committing to an on-going annual pledge.  Supporters may chose to sponsor a specific exhibit or offer a gift in memory of a former Crawford County resident.  In addition, folks who wish to volunteer their time to become a part of our volunteer team are always welcome.  Regardless of how little or how much, it all helps to make the Crawford County Historical Museum something we may all be very proud of.</p>
