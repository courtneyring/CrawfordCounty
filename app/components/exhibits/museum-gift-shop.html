            <p>Purchases can be made at the gift shop located in the bay room on the first floor of the museum. We have T-shirts, engineer caps, historical books, and a beautiful collection of items for sale by local artist, Cheryl Stephan Lowes. You can even purchase replica train tickets for the kids.</p>
            <p>Personnel at the museum are volunteers who are enthusiastic about the history of this area and will answer any questions they can about the early years. The museum is operated on the basis of donations, receiving no funds from any unit of government.</p>
            <p>The membership fee in the Historical Society is an important source of funding. New members are welcome and will be contributing to the repair and restoration of the buildings and to the further development of displays at the museum site.</p>
