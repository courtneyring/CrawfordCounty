            <p>The historical display of the famous AuSable River reveals its uses from the early days of the Native Americans. Today, the AuSable attracts many who want to fish or canoe.  An original 1915 riverboat hangs suspended from the lobby ceiling, while photos of men who built and guided the riverboats are exhibited. </p>
